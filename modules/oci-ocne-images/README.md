# oci-ocne-images

A terraform module that can select a specific OCI image from a given set.

This module selects the latest image from the list generated by operating system and version from OCI.  The `os` terraform variable corresponds to the same field in the OCI API query, as does the `os_version` variable.

In addition to providing the latest image via the `image_ocid` output, this module exposes the entire list via `all_images` if the full list of images for a given operating system and version is desired.

## Getting Started

The best place to start when using these Terraform modules is in the `terraform-oci-olcne` module.  This module deploys a complete OCNE stack including a Kubernetes cluster.
